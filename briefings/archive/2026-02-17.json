      "preview": "A looming pharma patent cliff is expected to impact $300 billion in drug sales by 2032.",
      "article": "The upcoming pharma patent cliff is projected to significantly affect drug sales, with estimates suggesting a potential impact of up to $300 billion by 2032. Originators must prepare for rapid revenue erosion as generics and biosimilars enter the market, while manufacturers of follow-on products see opportunities for commercial entry into established indications.\nWhy this matters: The anticipated loss of patent protections for key drugs like Eliquis and Entresto in 2026 could lead to steep price erosion and increased competition, ultimately benefiting health systems and patients through lower prices and broader access to essential medications.\nThe article discusses the implications of this patent cliff across various therapeutic areas, including oncology and metabolic diseases, highlighting the need for strategic responses from pharmaceutical companies to navigate the changing landscape.",

      "preview": "Lundbeck's bocunebart shows promise in migraine prevention but is limited to IV administration.",
      "article": "Lundbeck has announced positive results from the intravenous arm of its phase IIb PROCEED trial for bocunebart (Lu AG09222), a drug aimed at preventing migraines. The trial met its primary endpoint, showing a significant reduction in monthly migraine days compared to placebo.\nWhy this matters: Despite the positive results, the limitation to an intravenous formulation may narrow its commercial prospects. However, the drug's novel mechanism targeting PACAP could provide a new option for patients who have not responded to existing treatments. Lundbeck aims to advance to phase III discussions with regulators based on these findings.",

      "article": "Haoyu Cheng and his team have developed an algorithm that allows for complete human genome assembly without the need for expensive ultra-long DNA sequencing. This method significantly reduces the time and cost associated with genome assembly, making it more accessible for clinical diagnostics.\nWhy this matters: The ability to assemble genomes from standard sequencing data could revolutionize genetic diagnostics, enabling more reliable identification of disease-causing variations. This advancement could facilitate better understanding of genetic diseases and improve patient outcomes through more accurate diagnoses.",

      "article": "Researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory have discovered that fibroblasts known as myCAFs attract nerve fibers, creating an environment conducive to pancreatic cancer growth. This interaction occurs early in tumor development, suggesting potential therapeutic targets.\nWhy this matters: By understanding the role of nerve fibers in pancreatic cancer, researchers may identify new strategies to disrupt tumor formation. The findings indicate that existing drugs could be repurposed to target this myCAF-nerve interaction, potentially improving treatment outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer.",
