      "preview": "Rare Disease Day highlights the need for better access to therapies for rare diseases. Despite regulatory efforts, many patients still lack treatment options.",
      "article": "Rare Disease Day is held on the last day of February to raise awareness for rare diseases in a bid to improve the access to treatments, which are few and far between. While 27 medicines to address rare diseases have been pinned on the calendar this year for U.S. regulatory approval, there remains a dearth of therapies available for people with rare diseases. To put things into perspective, less than 5% of around the 7,000 known rare diseases have an approved therapy. This represents a critical, global unmet medical need.\n\nWhy this matters: Much of this is owed to regulatory and manufacturing hurdles that drug developers face. Traditional clinical trial designs are poorly suited for rare diseases, complicating the path towards drug approval. Despite the Orphan Drug Act's incentives, many argue they are insufficient to meet the urgent needs of patients. The Oxford-Harrington Rare Disease Centre aims to close the translational gap in rare disease drug development through funding and partnerships.",

      "article": "UniQure lost nearly half a billion dollars in market value Thursday, as comments made by the head of the Food and Drug Administration appeared to stoke investor fears that the company\u2019s most advanced research project won\u2019t be approved in the U.S. Shares of UniQure dropped more than 30% shortly after FDA Commissioner Martin Makary appeared on CNBC to defend the agency\u2019s approach to approving rare disease therapies.\n\nMakary's remarks, while not directly naming UniQure, led investors to interpret them as a reference to UniQure\u2019s AMT-130, a gene therapy for Huntington\u2019s disease. Despite the FDA's efforts to streamline rare disease drug development, recent regulatory shifts have left drugmakers confused. Analysts expect an update on UniQure\u2019s approval path during their upcoming earnings report.",

      "article": "Denmark's Novo Nordisk has signed a collaboration with Boston-based Vivtex Corporation to develop next-generation oral biologic medicines for obesity, diabetes, and associated metabolic diseases. Vivtex is eligible to receive payments totaling up to $2.1 billion, along with royalties on net sales of any resulting products.\n\nThis partnership comes at a crucial time for Novo Nordisk, which recently faced setbacks with its injectable obesity treatments. The collaboration aims to leverage Vivtex's innovative oral drug-delivery technologies, marking a significant step in Novo's strategy to compete in the oral biologics market.",

By developing a lysosomal-responsive lipid reporter, researchers discovered that E. coli tryptophan catabolism induces lysosomal lipid chaperone LBP-8, driving lipid mobilization.\n\nWhy this matters: Understanding how gut-derived metabolites modulate lysosomal function could unveil novel therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders linked to lysosomal dysfunction, highlighting the importance of microbiota in regulating host metabolism.",
