      "preview": "On January 11, 2026, the FDA implemented significant regulatory changes to increase flexibility for CGT manufacturing requirements, potentially accelerating product development while raising some safety concerns among experts.",
      "article": "The FDA announced major changes to chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) requirements for cell and gene therapies on January 11, 2026. Commissioner Marty Makary described these as \"common-sense reforms that will address the unique characteristics of CGTs and foster innovation.\" Key changes include allowing looser quality specifications during clinical trials and post-marketing, permitting specifications to be revised after approval, and dropping the requirement for three Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) rounds before commercial production in certain cases. The changes reflect what FDA Director Vinay Prasad noted as \"an explosive growth of CGT submissions, many of which target serious or life-threatening conditions with an unmet medical need.\" However, experts have raised concerns about the potential risks of reduced oversight. UC Davis professor Paul Knoepfler noted that while the flexible system may accelerate beneficial CGT development, \"recipients of some of these emerging therapies will face more risks\" and there could be \"new risks for the whole CGT field.\" The changes support the \"plausible mechanism pathway\" approach championed by Makary and Prasad, which shifts regulatory focus from approving individual drugs to clearing therapeutic platforms.",

      "preview": "Belgian biotech Galapagos confirmed on January 5, 2026, it will proceed with shuttering its cell therapy operations, affecting 365 employees across multiple sites after receiving no viable acquisition offers.",
      "article": "Galapagos NV officially announced on January 5, 2026, that its Board of Directors has decided to initiate the wind-down of the company's cell therapy activities after completing works council consultations. The decision follows a comprehensive strategic review and failed sale process that began in October 2025. CEO Henry Gosebruch stated that \"no viable proposals were received with terms or financing that would reasonably support the business' future.\" The wind-down will impact approximately 365 employees across Europe, the U.S., and China, with closures of facilities in Leiden (Netherlands), Basel (Switzerland), Princeton and Pittsburgh (U.S.), and Shanghai (China). The company expects operating costs of €100-125 million through 2026 and one-time restructuring costs of €150-200 million. Galapagos will maintain presence at its headquarters in Mechelen, Belgium, and hubs in Chicago and San Francisco, focusing on transformational business development with its €3 billion cash position. The move reflects broader challenges in the CGT field, with other companies like Takeda and Novo Nordisk also announcing similar exits from cell therapy in recent months.",

      "preview": "UNSW Sydney researchers published a Nature Communications study demonstrating a new CRISPR approach that reactivates silenced genes without cutting DNA, potentially offering safer sickle cell disease treatments.",
      "article": "Scientists at UNSW Sydney, in collaboration with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, published breakthrough research in Nature Communications (DOI: 10.1038/s41467-025-62177-z) demonstrating a new form of CRISPR that can reactivate silenced genes without cutting DNA. The technique uses modified CRISPR systems to deliver enzymes that remove methyl groups from DNA, effectively \"lifting the brakes\" on silenced genes. Lead author Professor Merlin Crossley explained: \"We showed very clearly that if you brush the cobwebs off, the gene comes on. And when we added the methyl groups back to the genes, they turned off again. So, these compounds aren't cobwebs -- they're anchors.\" The research settles a long-standing debate about whether DNA methylation actively silences genes or merely accompanies gene silencing. For therapeutic applications, particularly in sickle cell disease, the approach could reactivate the fetal globin gene to compensate for defective adult globin genes. The method avoids the cancer risk associated with DNA cutting approaches. \"Whenever you cut DNA, there's a risk of cancer,\" Crossley noted. \"But if we can do gene therapy that doesn't involve snipping DNA strands, then we avoid these potential pitfalls.\" The team will next test the approach in animal models.",

      "article": "The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT) and Orphan Therapeutics Accelerator (OTXL) announced on January 7, 2026, a partnership to establish CGTxchange, a jointly owned clearinghouse and marketplace for deprioritized cell and gene therapies. The initiative addresses a critical challenge where \"policy and economic shifts in recent years have led biopharma sponsors to halt development of hundreds of CGTs no longer considered commercially viable by traditional industry standards, including many that delivered clear benefits to patients in trials.\" ASGCT CEO David Barrett stated: \"At ASGCT, we have observed that a host of cell and gene therapies are being set aside not because they lack clinical merit, but rather due to the challenges of commercializing these therapies once approved.\" The platform will utilize OTXL's AI-based system to create searchable databases and risk-based assessments of shelved therapies, matching them with potential investors, nonprofits, or academic institutions. CGTxchange will launch in mid-2026, representing a novel approach to ensuring promising therapies reach patients despite commercial challenges. The venture leverages ASGCT's network of over 3,000 members across 60+ countries and OTXL's alternative development and financing models for ultra-rare conditions.",

      "article": "Market research firm Astute Analytica published comprehensive analysis on January 27, 2026, projecting the global cell and gene therapy market will reach $183.1 billion by 2035, representing a compound annual growth rate of 17.5% from its 2024 valuation of $36.5 billion. The robust growth is attributed to an \"extraordinary number of studies underway\" with over 2,500 active Investigational New Drug (IND) applications filed with the FDA. Key growth drivers include expansion of GMP manufacturing facilities and the Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) ecosystem to meet specialized production needs. The FDA approved nine new CGT products in 2024, demonstrating regulatory momentum that \"encourages pharmaceutical and biotech companies to innovate aggressively.\" The analysis highlights the \"proactive and supportive regulatory environment fostered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\" as critical to market dominance. Manufacturing complexity remains a challenge, with CGTs being \"inherently complex biologic products, often individualized for patients\" requiring \"sophisticated manufacturing under time constraints.\" The report notes growing demand for specialized facilities complying with Good Manufacturing Practice standards as more innovative therapies advance through clinical trials toward commercialization.",
