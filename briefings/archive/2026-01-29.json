      "article": "Pfizer has announced the start of enrollment for a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating its novel RNA therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The trial will assess the safety and efficacy of the therapy in ambulatory boys aged 4 to 7 years with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD.\\n\\nThe therapy is designed to address the underlying genetic cause of DMD by restoring the production of dystrophin, a key structural protein in muscle cells. If successful, this approach could represent a significant advancement in the management of this devastating neuromuscular disorder. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 120 participants across multiple sites globally.\\n\\nWhy this matters: The initiation of this Phase 3 trial marks an important milestone in the development of a potential new treatment option for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and progressive genetic condition that currently has limited therapeutic options.",
