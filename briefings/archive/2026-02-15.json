      "preview": "In a recent congressional hearing, BIO President John F. Crowley discussed the role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in driving up drug costs.",
      "article": "Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) were identified as a major driver behind higher prescription drug costs in a congressional hearing that featured testimony from BIO President & CEO John F. Crowley.\nRepresenting the membership of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) in the House Energy & Commerce Health Subcommittee\u2019s Feb. 11 hearing, Crowley explained how Congress can help make drugs more accessible while maintaining U.S. biotech leadership.\nWhy this matters: The hearing emphasized the need for reforms to improve drug accessibility and highlighted the significant financial burden that PBMs impose on the healthcare system.",

      "article": "Researchers have unveiled the critical role of the enzyme UBE2M as a link between neddylation and cell cycle regulation in colorectal adenocarcinoma. The study shows that UBE2M facilitates the conjugation of NEDD8 to cullin proteins, promoting tumor cell proliferation by destabilizing cell cycle inhibitors.\nWhy this matters: Targeting UBE2M could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer, potentially leading to more effective treatments with fewer side effects.",
