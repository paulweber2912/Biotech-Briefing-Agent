      "preview": "This article highlights six notable RNAi biotech companies making strides in the field.",
      "article": "Over the past two decades, RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as one of biotech\u2019s most powerful approaches for precisely targeting disease at its genetic root. The field has grown quickly, with many RNAi companies racing to develop medicines targeting diseases ranging from rare genetic disorders to common cardiovascular conditions.\nWhy this matters: The advancements in RNAi technology could lead to breakthroughs in treating previously 'undruggable' targets with high specificity. Companies like Aerska, ADARx Pharmaceuticals, and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals are at the forefront, developing innovative therapies that could transform treatment paradigms for various diseases.\nRecent funding and trial updates from these companies indicate a promising future for RNAi therapeutics, potentially addressing significant unmet medical needs.",

      "preview": "A Phase I trial of BioNTech's mRNA vaccine for breast cancer shows promising immune responses.",
      "article": "A recent Phase I trial published in Nature explored the use of mRNA vaccines targeting cancer neoantigens in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Despite the small sample size of 14 patients, the study reported that all participants developed vaccine-induced T-cell responses against multiple neoantigens, with eleven remaining relapse-free for up to six years.\nWhy this matters: This trial revives interest in mRNA cancer vaccines, particularly for aggressive cancers like TNBC, where traditional therapies often fail. The findings suggest that personalized neoantigen mRNA vaccines may offer durable immunity, paving the way for future studies and potential combination therapies.",

      "article": "The FDA has introduced new draft guidance aimed at streamlining the approval process for personalized therapies targeting ultra-rare diseases. This initiative follows the successful treatment of a baby with a CRISPR-based therapy, highlighting the need for regulatory frameworks that accommodate individualized treatments.\nWhy this matters: The new guidelines could significantly accelerate the development of therapies for conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 patients, addressing a critical gap in the current drug approval process. By allowing for a single well-controlled clinical investigation to support approval, the FDA aims to encourage innovation in the treatment of rare diseases.",

      "article": "In a Phase II trial, MoonLake Immunotherapeutics\u2019 sonelokimab showed that 81% of patients met the ASAS40 response criteria for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). This single-domain antibody fragment targets IL-17A and IL-17F, cytokines known to drive inflammation in axSpA.\nWhy this matters: The trial results position sonelokimab as a strong contender against UCB\u2019s Bimzelx, which has already received approval for axSpA. The promising efficacy data, combined with imaging evidence of improved inflammation, could support MoonLake's efforts to gain FDA approval and expand its market presence.",
