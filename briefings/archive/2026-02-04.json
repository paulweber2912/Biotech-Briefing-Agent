      "preview": "A study explores the use of single-stranded DNA templates to improve CRISPR gene editing precision.",
      "article": "Recent advancements in genome editing technologies, particularly CRISPR-Cas9 systems, have highlighted the potential of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a homology-directed repair (HDR) template. A study led by Velangani et al. investigates the complexities of generating effective ssDNA-based HDR templates, which could significantly enhance the precision of genome editing processes.\nWhy this matters: The findings could revolutionize gene therapy applications, offering new strategies for treating genetic disorders by improving the accuracy of genome editing. The research emphasizes the importance of ssDNA template design and delivery methods, which could lead to more effective therapeutic interventions in the future.",

      "article": "The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to hear Hikma Pharmaceuticals v. Amarin Pharma centers on the marketing of a generic drug with a skinny label. This case raises questions about the liability of generic manufacturers for patent infringement when promoting a product that may lead to off-label prescriptions.\nWhy this matters: The outcome could significantly affect how generic drugs are marketed and the protection of additional indications developed after a drug's initial approval, impacting both innovation incentives and generic access in the pharmaceutical market.",
