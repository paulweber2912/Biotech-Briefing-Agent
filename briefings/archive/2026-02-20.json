      "article": "Research published in Genes & Diseases identifies USP30-AS1 as a key long non-coding RNA involved in breast cancer progression. The study shows that USP30-AS1 is upregulated in aggressive breast cancer subtypes and plays a crucial role in cell proliferation by suppressing the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21.\n\nThe findings suggest that targeting USP30-AS1 could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment. Why this matters: Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs like USP30-AS1 can lead to new approaches in cancer therapy and improve prognostic assessments for patients.",
