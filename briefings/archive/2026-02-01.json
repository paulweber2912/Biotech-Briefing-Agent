      "preview": "Johnson & Johnson is focusing on oncology and immunology as it navigates market pressures.",
      "article": "As 2026 gets underway, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is navigating an inflection point that involves balancing a maturing internal pipeline with evolving external pressures on pricing, policy, and dealmaking. The company has set a positive outlook for the coming year, projecting sales between $100 billion and $101 billion, up from $94.2 billion last year.\n\nWhy this matters: J&J's strategy reflects a prioritization of core therapeutic strengths, particularly in oncology, where it aims to become the number one company in the field. The success of its cancer portfolio, including drugs like Darzalex and Tecvayli, is crucial for offsetting losses from its immunology segment, especially following the loss of exclusivity for Stelara. J&J's approach to diversifying its pipeline and focusing on innovative therapies could significantly impact its market position in 2026.",
