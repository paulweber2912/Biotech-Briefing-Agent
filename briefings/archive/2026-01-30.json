      "article": "French biotech company Sensorion announced today a \u20ac60 million (about $72 million) reserved offering including a \u20ac20 million strategic investment from Sanofi. The remaining \u20ac40 million was subscribed by existing shareholders and new investors.\n\nThe Montpellier-based biotech said its cash runway has been extended to the first half of 2027. The new funding will support the advancement of its genetic programs, including SENS-601 and SENS-501, targeting genetic forms of hearing loss. Specific milestones include regulatory approval for Clinical Trial Applications and first patient enrollment for SENS-601.\n\nWhy this matters: This funding positions Sensorion to focus on advancing its lead gene therapy programs through critical regulatory and clinical milestones, potentially bringing transformative treatments for genetic hearing loss closer to patients.",

      "article": "Researchers have uncovered a crucial link between circadian rhythms and the success of cord blood transplantation (CBT), highlighting how the timing of procedures can influence the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD).\n\nThe study found that higher levels of soluble CD26 at certain times can suppress T cell activity that causes aGVHD, suggesting optimal timing for transplantations. This insight could lead to personalized transplant protocols that align with patients' biological rhythms.\n\nWhy this matters: Understanding the impact of circadian biology on transplantation could significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce complications associated with aGVHD.",
