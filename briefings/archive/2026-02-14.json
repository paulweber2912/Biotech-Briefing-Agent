      "preview": "In a recent congressional hearing, BIO President & CEO John F. Crowley addressed the role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in rising drug costs.",
      "article": "Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) were identified as a major driver behind higher prescription drug costs in a congressional hearing that featured testimony from BIO President & CEO John F. Crowley.\nRepresenting the membership of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) in the House Energy & Commerce Health Subcommittee\u2019s Feb. 11 hearing, Crowley explained how Congress can help make drugs more accessible while maintaining U.S. biotech leadership.\nWhy this matters: The hearing emphasized the need for reforms to improve drug accessibility and highlighted the significant financial burden PBMs impose on the healthcare system. Crowley urged Congress to consider further measures to reform PBMs and improve the regulatory landscape for drug approval and access.",

      "article": "The shadow of a childhood cancer diagnosis often stretches far beyond the final round of chemotherapy or the last session of radiation. A significant subset of these survivors carries a hidden genetic burden that predisposes them to life-threatening events. A groundbreaking study published in Lancet Regional Health \u2013 Americas utilized telehealth to bridge the gap between survivorship and preventive genetics.\nThe study revealed that remote telehealth services significantly increased the uptake of genetic counseling and testing among childhood cancer survivors, demonstrating that logistical barriers often hinder access to necessary care.\nWhy this matters: This research underscores the potential of telehealth to democratize access to genetic services, allowing for earlier detection and preventive measures that could save lives.",
