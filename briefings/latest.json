      "article": "On January 11, 2026, the FDA announced a significantly more flexible approach to overseeing chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) requirements for cell and gene therapies. These changes, described as potentially the largest ever to CGT oversight in the U.S., allow manufacturers to avoid compliance with 21 CFR part 211 before phase 2/3 trials and provide greater flexibility in establishing product release specifications. The agency's approach recognizes that small patient populations targeted by CGT therapies don't allow for large numbers of manufacturing lots to support traditional specifications. While this could accelerate beneficial CGT development, critics warn it may increase risks for therapy recipients and potentially damage the field's credibility if safety issues emerge. The new system represents a careful balance between innovation and oversight in an increasingly competitive CGT landscape.",

      "article": "Scientists at UNSW Sydney have developed a groundbreaking CRISPR-based 'epigenome editing' technique that can turn genes on without cutting DNA, potentially offering a safer approach to treating genetic diseases like sickle cell disease. The method uses a modified CRISPR system to deliver enzymes that remove methyl groups from DNA, effectively releasing the genetic brakes that keep certain genes switched off. This approach specifically targets the fetal globin gene, which could provide a workaround for the faulty adult globin gene causing sickle cell diseases. The research, published in Nature Communications, settles a long-running scientific debate by confirming that chemical markers actively silence genes rather than appearing as harmless byproducts. Professor Merlin Crossley noted this avoids the cancer risk associated with DNA cutting, stating it 'opens the door to powerful therapies with fewer unintended side effects.' The work represents the beginning of third-generation CRISPR technology focused on epigenetic modifications rather than direct DNA alterations.",

      "article": "The global cell and gene therapy market is projected to surge from $36.5 billion in 2024 to $183.1 billion by 2035, representing a compound annual growth rate of 17.5%, according to Astute Analytica. This robust growth is underpinned by extraordinary clinical trial activity, with more than 2,500 active Investigational New Drug applications filed with the FDA. The FDA's supportive regulatory environment contributed significantly, approving nine new CGT products in 2024 alone. The expansion is driving unprecedented demand for specialized GMP manufacturing facilities and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization services to support the complex production processes unique to cell and gene therapies. However, the sector faces ongoing challenges in translating scientific success into commercial viability, as highlighted by companies like Takeda discontinuing cell therapy efforts in October 2025 and Galapagos announcing a wind-down of cell therapy activities in January 2026. The dichotomy between scientific achievement and commercial execution remains a defining characteristic of the CGT field entering 2026.",

      "article": "The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy and Orphan Therapeutics Accelerator announced a partnership to establish CGTxchange, a jointly owned clearinghouse and marketplace for deprioritized cell and gene therapies. The initiative addresses a growing challenge where policy and economic shifts have led biopharma sponsors to halt development of hundreds of CGTs no longer considered commercially viable by traditional standards, despite many showing clear patient benefits in trials. CGTxchange will utilize OTXL's AI-based platform to create a secure, searchable database of shelved therapies, providing risk-based assessments and matching assets with prospective investors or partners. ASGCT CEO David Barrett emphasized that many CGTs are being abandoned 'not because they lack clinical merit, but rather due to the challenges of commercializing these therapies once approved.' The platform, targeting a mid-2026 launch, represents an unprecedented approach to ensuring promising therapies reach organizations ready to tackle development and commercialization challenges that traditional industry players find economically unfeasible.",

      "article": "The convergence of Big Pharma and venture capital investment is betting billions that artificial intelligence can decode the infinite complexity of drug discovery, with companies like Isomorphic Labs securing a massive $600 million Series A in March 2025. The financing push stems from AlphaFold 2's success in solving the protein folding problem, which earned founder Demis Hassabis a Nobel Prize in 2024. Major pharmaceutical alliances are targeting 'undruggable' diseases, focusing on protein mutations in pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancers that have historically resisted treatment. However, the transition from algorithmic prediction to clinical cure remains challenging. As of January 2026, Isomorphic Labs has yet to advance a drug into clinical trials, while competitors like Insilico have candidates in Chinese trials. Novartis president Fiona Marshall suggests AI could shave five years off discovery timelines, but human safety trials cannot be algorithmically bypassed. The traditional drug discovery process costs over $2 billion and takes more than a decade, with a 90% failure rate in clinical trials, creating enormous pressure for AI solutions to deliver on their computational promises.",
